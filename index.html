        <h3>place</h3>
        <p>Iringal is a beautiful little village near Vadakara in Kozhikode has a special place in the history of Kerala.
        We are inviting you to Iringal. History encounters you in lots of ways at Iringal.
        It might come to you as a whiff of a war fought in the bygone era, the renowned resistance of Kunjali Marakkar
        against the Portuguese, or it might resound in your tympanum as the squall of the ghosts of giant granites,
            splintered ruthlessly by gunpowder.
            Besides history, the place is also known as the hub of traditional craftsmanship.
            It is Sargaalaya, the Kerala Arts and Crafts village at Iringal in Kerala, an initiative
            of the Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala. It is an exclusive place in Kerala where
            one can not only pick a product fashioned by the traditional artisans but also learn one or two lessons
            in the subtleties of craft-making. Conceptualized as a tourist destination, Sargaalaya was developed and
            implemented on the Responsible Tourism model.</p>

    <p>I am including my achivements here.Listing my achivements herea web development role, in order to stay up to date with
        ever more frequent technological advancements and updates.Personal skills are very much important to
        achieve the strategic goals of the organization. Actually Personal skills are those which are concerned
        with how people manage and express themselves. Some of the personal skills an individual learn in his early
        age by his parents and his community like how to talk to others? And some skills he needs to learn for his
        career like word typing speed per minute. Whatever kind of a personal skill is a person develops it with
        passage of time, however some persons have ability to learn these skills more quickly.
        A person, who wants to be successful in life, keeps on developing personal skills as George Bernard Shaw.
